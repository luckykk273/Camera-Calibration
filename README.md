# Camera-Calibration
## Preface
In this repository, we do camera calibration from scratch. For convenience, 
we will use some opencv libraries when it is nothing to do with camera calibration(e.g. reading images or finding 
chessboard corners). The purpose of this repository is to know camera calibration better.
## Support Models
### Camera Number
**NOTE: No matter how many cameras are used, you can see it as multi-monocular.**
 - Monocular only
### Camera(Projection) Model
- pinhole
### Distortion Model
- radial-tangential (radtan)
